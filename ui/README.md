# Frontend Development Test

## Task: hCard Builder

[hCard is a simple, open format for publishing people, companies and
organizations on the web](http://microformats.org/wiki/hCard).

Our ever-vigilant design/UX team has put together a layout for an app, *hCard
Builder*. This app is something we would like to use in the future when allowing
users to edit their personal details on our site.

Based on the design provided (in `design.psd`), build the *hCard Builder* app in
HTML/CSS/JS, as if it was going to be shipped live at the end of the next sprint
once fully verified working by the testing team.

(**Note:** If you don't have Photoshop available, you can see examples of the
empty & completed states in the two provided `.png` files)

Allow approximately 4-5 hours to complete the task.

### Requirements

* As the form is filled out, the preview should be automatically updated
* The preview should implement the hCard format
* The submit button does not need to function (ie; no backend is required for
  this task)
* When the user selects an image, a thumbnail should be shown in the preview
  (no backend is required for this task)
* The app should be responsive for different screen widths
* The app should work in the latest version of the Chrome browser
* Use React

### Guidelines

* We are interested in your coding style and how you solve problems. To this
  end, please include your source code and any build steps / explanations we may
  need to test the submission
* Please make sure your HTML is valid
* Please structure the code for reusability
* Where possible, keep SEO in mind
* We want to see your React skills, but feel free to use any additional libraries,

### Submission

Please submit a *complete* copy of the source code you wrote for this test by pushing
it to an online git repo of your choice: GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, etc - your call! 
As long as we can access your repo it's all good.

Upon submission, please also give us a guide to how long you spent on the test
(There is no wrong answer! We iterate on this test based on the average time
